In order to provide relevant information, the application needs to know your location. The location service is crucial to this application and it will not work if not provided. London Bicycles does not record any personal information. 
                       The only personal information it needs is the location of the client. Neither location nor other personal information is recorded or used by the application for purposes other than providing information to the client."
